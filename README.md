# theEncrypter
The encryptAll file encrypts and all files (.jpg by default) in a predefined folder, and puts the encrypted files in a seperate folder. 
The decryptAll file takes the encrypted files (.enc) from that folder, decrypts them (into .jpg) and puts them in a different folder, completing the chain.
